Types of users;
By default in Linux OS, we have 2 types of users;
	1. ec2-user (default)
	2. root

ec2-user Vs. root 
ec2-user doesn't allow you to install softwares/packages
ec2-user doesn't allow you to create new users
ec2-user doesn't have administrator permissions

root user have all the privileges 

sudo su (or) sudo -i (or) sudo -s
exit (or) control + d

To create files;
touch
cat
vi (or) vim

ls (or) ls -l (or) ll
touch <FileName>

kastro1.java kastro2.java .... kastro10.java
touch kastro{1..5}.java

cat command will allow you to create a file and also allows you to write the content inside that file
Note: If the file is not available, cat command will first create that file and then allows you to write the content

cat > kastro.txt
cat kastro.txt
cat >> kastro.txt (It will preserve the existing content and will allows you to write the new content)

touch Vs. cat
touch will create an empty file
cat will create a file and allows you to write the content
cat command will overwrite the existing content and will only keep the latest content (>)

vi is a text editor in Linux
Using vi we can create a file and also we can write the content inside a file

vi kastro.txt
Go into the insert mode ----> press "i" ----> Write the content 
To save and come out of the file ----> press "esc" ----> To save and quit from the file ----> :wq ---> Hit "enter"
:wq ---> save and quit
:q! ---> force quite without saving
:w ---> only to save, not to quit from the file

rm -rf *

To create directories;
Directory is nothing but a folder
mkdir <Name>

To find whether it is a file or a directory;
Execute ll (or) ls -l
If the first character is "d", then it is a directory
If the first character is "-", then it is a file

cd .. ---> Change Directory

~ ----> represents default path (/home/ec2-user) (/home/ubuntu)

Wherever you are there in Linux, if you want to go to /root path, execute "cd"

rmdir <Dir.Name>
